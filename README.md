This version of the Bookmark App is connected to the backend bookmark-server and database that I created and deployed to heroku.


The following Bookmark App was created by Shannon Lichtenwalter.

This is an interactive Bookmarking app that allows the user to save information about their favorite webpages all in one place. 

The following User Stories are implemented in the app.
    As a user:
    [x] I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
      [x]title
      [x]url link
      [x]description
      [x]rating (1-5)
    [x]I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
    [x]All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
    [x]I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
    [x]Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
    [x]I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list
    [x]I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
    [x]Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
    [x]I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
